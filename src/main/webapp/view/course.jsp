				<p>Explaining the Purpose of the Video Dhruv acknowledges that
					he has been asked many times to make a video on starting a YouTube
					channel and earning money. He states that he will share his
					knowledge and experiences on this topic. "And that topic is - How
					to make a video? How does one become a Youtuber? How to earn money
					from Youtube? And how do I make these videos? What is the truth
					behind them? Today, I'd like to tell you all about it. Shall we
					begin?" Dhruv Rathee's Equipment Dhruv shows his current studio
					setup, including two hanging lights, a green sheet, and a
					teleprompter. "Let me take you on a tour of my equipment. This is
					my studio setup these days. There are two lights hanging, one green
					sheet that hangs as well. And there's a third light down there. And
					this is the camera. I've even bought a teleprompter now."

					Importance of Having a Good Setup Dhruv mentions that while his
					upgraded setup is good, it is not necessary to start a YouTube
					career. He shares that he originally started with only a mobile
					phone. "You don't need such a huge and upgraded setup to start your
					Youtube career. I started mine with merely a mobile phone. In this
					video, I will tell you all that you can achieve on Youtube with a
					mobile phone and without spending any money." Importance of
					Scripting Dhruv emphasizes the importance of having a rough script
					before making a video. He explains that most videos require
					scripting, including comedy videos. Dhruv shows his own script,
					which consists of bullet points and paragraphs. "But more important
					than these technical things is - before making any video, you need
					to have a rough script on what you are going to say in the video.
					Have you researched on it? There are some exceptions to this though
					- for example, you do not need a script while vlogging. But most of
					the videos that are made on Youtube require a script."</p>

				<p>Why is Java platform independent? Why not C & C++? When you
					run a C native code, it will be executed immediately. Whereas in
					the case of Java, when you run the byte code, the byte code will
					first be converted into native code and then be will executed. When
					we say that java is platform independent, it means that the byte
					code is independent of any platforms. When you create a .exe, it
					captures a machine code, where as when we create a byte code it
					does not capture machine code. Java programming language was
					developed by the Sun Microsystems and was launched in 1995. The
					language has had many versions, the latest being Java SE 8, and
					still finds relevance in the industry. Java Program Execution Java
					Compiler Java Interpreter JIT Compiler JVM JDK & JRE Java
					Installation Points to Remember Process of Java Program Execution
					Human readable code with java syntax (.java file) ⇒ (javac
					compiler) ⇒ Byte Code (.class file) ⇒ (java interpreter) ⇒ native
					code The components involved in writing program up to getting the
					output are: java.exe set up file Javac compiler, which checks
					syntax Java interpreter, which understands only byte code and
					converts it to native code Human readable code with proper java
					syntax, i.e. the Java File Byte code - after the compiler compiles
					the Java File, i.e. Class file Native code - We see output same in
					background is native code out of all these, only the byte code is
					platform independent.</p>

				<p><h1>Sundar Pichai Leaves Audience SPEECHLESS | Google CEO
					Motivational video</h1> The Long Arc of History Sundar Pichai explains
					why he believes the audience will prevail. He points out that many
					others have overcome challenges before them, giving them hope for
					success in their own endeavors. "The reason I know you'll prevail
					is because so many others have done it before you." Underestimating
					the Next Generation Pichai highlights the trend of each generation
					underestimating the potential of the following generation. He
					emphasizes that progress made by one generation becomes the
					foundation for the next, and it takes new individuals to realize
					all the possibilities. "It's because they don't realize that the
					progress of one generation becomes the foundational premise for the
					next." Personal Experience with Access to Technology Pichai shares
					that he grew up with limited access to technology, not getting a
					telephone until he was 10 and not having regular access to a
					computer until he came to America for graduate school. He reveals
					the financial sacrifices his father made for him to come to the
					United States. "I grew up without much access to technology. We
					didn't get our first telephone till I was 10. I didn't have regular
					access to a computer until I came to America for graduate school."</p>
